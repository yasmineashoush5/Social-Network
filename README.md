# Social-Network
With the launch of networking sites like Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter, the number of people actively engaging in social networking has only risen. Social networks are not only a platform where users share their thoughts and create friends' lists, they are also a perfect source for news, entertainment, and business
Marketers are incorporating new ways to increase their brand reach and get to the right audience. And what better way to find your audience than to utilize the power of social networking?
Social media strategy not only requires platforms that have the most users, but these platforms should also serve your business needs well. For that reason, 
I built an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends’ thoughts, and create a friend list, and also get in touch with all the new things that happen everyday.
I used Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM.
